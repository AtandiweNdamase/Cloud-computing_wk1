Cloud computing is the delivery computing services over the internet. such as IT infrastructures , virtual machinnes,storage ,databases and networking.Cloud services also expand to IOT and macine learning and AI
Compute power - how much processing your computer can do.eg RAM
Storage - volume of data YOU CAN STORE ON YOUR COMPUTER.
cloud computing - reqaust more storage , backup and prossessing power
SLA - service level agreements - the availiablity of the service provided 
99% uptime - availablity means the serive can be down  available 432min/month - 10min per week. 
99.9 % uptime - availabilty means the service can hae a downtime of 43.2 min/month per week.
Scaling generally comes in two varieties vertical and horizontal . Vertical - increasing and decreasing capabilities of resources. Horizontal scaling is adding or subtracting the number of resouces.
Vertical Scaling 
with vertical scaling , if you were developing an app and you needed nore processing power, scalw upby putting more CPUs or RAM.
Reliablility - is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function.
Cloud-based auditing helps flag any resource that’s out of compliance with your corporate standards and provides mitigation strategies.
 If you want patches and maintenance taken care of automatically, platform as a service or software as a service deployments may be the best cloud strategies for you.
 Management in the cloud :
 through a web portal 
 using command lne interface
 using APis
 Using PowerShell
That OpEx cost can be impacted by many factors. Some of the impacting factors are:
Resource type - resource setting and the Azure region have an impact on resource cost
Consumption
Maintenance
Geography -The cost of power, labor, taxes, and fees vary depending on the location. Due to these variations, Azure resources can differ in costs to deploy depending on the region.
Subscription type
Neteork traffic- A zone is a geographical grouping of Azure regions for billing purposes. 
Azure Marketplace
Azure infrastructure is distributed globally, which enables you to deploy your services centrally or closest to your customers, or something in between. With this global deployment comes global pricing differences.
The pricing calculator and the total cost of ownership (TCO) calculator are two calculators that help you understand potential Azure expenses
The TCO calculator is designed to help you compare the costs for running an on-premises infrastructure compared to an Azure Cloud infrastructure.

Azure PowerShell is a shell with which developers, DevOps, and IT professionals can run commands called command-lets (cmdlets). These commands call the Azure REST API to perform management tasks in Azure. Cmdlets can be run independently to handle one-off changes, or they may be combined to help orchestrate complex actions such as:

The routine setup, teardown, and maintenance of a single resource or multiple connected resources.
The deployment of an entire infrastructure, which might contain dozens or hundreds of resources, from imperative code.
